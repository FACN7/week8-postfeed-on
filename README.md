## user journey

We are the 7th cohort of Founders & Coders and we want our own social platform. And now we can:

* Sign up to the application
* Log in to the pplication
* See all the posts on the main page
* Add a new post to the feed
* Upload a picture to the post using URL 
* If there is no picture, or pic URL doesn't include JPG or PNG extension, only the text content will be uploaded
* Log out


## our process:

- [x] Set up project architecture
- [x] Set up a server
- [x] Set up a database
- [x] Host on Heroku incl database
